.Op Fl dhjosv
.Op Fl b Ar BYTES

.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
can be used to join IPv4 and IPv6 multicast groups, display progress as
multicast packets are received, or sent when acting as sender, and also
send multicast packets on select groups.
.Pp
.Bd -ragged -offset center
.Sy Note:
an IPv6 group with custom port must be written as
.Ar [ADDR]:port ,
i.e., with enclosing brackets.
.Ed
.Pp
.Nm
can help verify intended IGMP snooping functionality in layer-2 bridges
(switches), as well as verify forwarding of multicast in static
.Nm ( SMCRoute )
or dynamic
.Nm ( mrouted ,
.Nm pimd ,
.Nm pimd-dense ,
or
.Nm pim6sd )
multicast routing setups.
.Pp
.Nm
supports source-specific multicast, SSM (S,G), as well as any-source
multicast, ASM (*,G).  The source IP of an (S,G) pair is an optional
argument that must precede the group and be separated with a comma.  No
spaces are allowed between source and group in this form.  Multiple
(S,G) pairs are separated with space.
.Pp
.Nm
does not create or send IGMP or MLD frames directly.  It only asks the
underlying UNIX kernel for groups from a specific interface, which is
then converted to the appropriate wire format by the kernel.  This
means, for instance, that if you want to create an IGMP v3 membership
report on the wire that joins one group from multiple sources, you tell
.Nm
to join two (S,G) pairs.  The conversion to IGMP v3 report format is
done by the kernel.
.Pp
On Linux systems you can change the IGMP version of an interface, and
thus what type of packets the kernel generates, by writing to the file
.Pa /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/eth0/force_igmp_version .
E.g., to change
.Cm eth0
to IGMPv2:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
echo 2 | sudo tee /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/eth0/force_igmp_version
.Ed
.Sh OPTIONS
With no options given
.Nm
acts as a multicast receiver (or sink), joining the default group
225.1.2.3, listening on the default interface, eth0, binding to the
default port, 1234.
.Pp
Use the following options to adjust this behavior:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl b Ar BYTES
Payload in bytes over IP/UDP header (42 bytes), default: 100
.It Fl c Ar COUNT
Stop sending/receiving after COUNT number of packets
.It Fl d
Run as a daemon in the background, detached from the current terminal.
All output, except progress is sent to
.Xr syslog 3
.It Fl f Ar MSEC
Frequency, poll/send every MSEC milliseconds, default: 100
.It Fl h
Print a summary of the options and exit
.It Fl i Ar IFNAME
Interface to use for sending/receiving multicast, default: eth0
.It Fl j
Join groups, default unless acting as sender
.It Fl l Ar LEVEL
Control
.Nm
log level; none, notice, debug.  Default: notice
.It Fl o
Old (plain/ordinary/original) output, no fancy progress bars
.It Fl p Ar PORT
UDP port number to send/listen to, default: 1234
.It Fl s
Act as sender, sends packets to select groups, 1/100 msec, default: no
.It Fl t Ar TTL
TTL to use when sending multicast packets, default: 1
.It Fl v
Show version information
.It Fl w Ar SEC
Initial wait, sleep
.Ar SEC
seconds before starting anything.  Useful for scripting test systems
that launch
.Nm
at boot without syncing with networking bring-up
.It Fl W Ar SEC
Timeout, in seconds, before
.Nm
exits, regardless of how many packets have been received.  With this
option
.Nm
exit either after
.Ar SEC
seconds, or after
.Ar COUNT
packets have been received
.El
.Sh USAGE
To verify multicast connectivity, the simplest way is to run
.Nm
on one system, without arguments, and on the other with the command
option
.Ar -s .
In this setup one system joins the group
.Ar 225.1.2.3
waiting for packets to arrive, and the other end starts sending packets
to the same group.  To verify routing of multicast, make sure to add the
.Fl t Ar TTL
option to the sender since the default TTL is 1 and every router
(simplified) decrements the TTL.
.Pp
For a more advanced example, say you want to verify that your topology
can forward 20 consecutive groups in the MCAST_TEST_NET, as defined in
RFC5771.  Simply add the following as a standalone argument to both the
receiver and the sender:
.Ar 233.252.0.1+20
.Pp
For non-consecutive groups, simply add them in any order you want, up to
250 groups are supported:
.Ar 225.1.2.3 226.3.2.1+12 225.3.2.42 232.43.211.234
.Pp
To run
.Nm
as both a sender and a receiver on the same host you will likely need to
employ something like network namespaces (Linux netns) for at least one
of them.  Otherwise the network stack will likely let the sender's data
stream take a short cut to the receiver, without passing through an
actual wire.
.Pp
Also, like most network applications, to run properly
.Nm
needs both the loopback (lo) interface and a default route set up.  At
least in the default (receiver) case.  In a network namespace neither of
these are set up by default.
